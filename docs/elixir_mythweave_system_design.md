# üéÆ MythWeave MMORPG System Design & Integration (Elixir Edition)

## Version: 1.1  
## Target: Elixir-based Modular MMORPG Server with Zone Mutability  
## Audience: Systems Engineers, Gameplay Developers, LiveOps Engineers  

---

## üìå Overview

**MythWeave** is a modular MMORPG server framework built on **Elixir and the BEAM VM**, enabling large-scale simulation of emergent world systems, reactive zones, procedural storytelling, and expressive combat. Its architecture leverages lightweight concurrency, fault-tolerant supervision trees, and hot-swappable world logic to support seamless, player-driven experiences.

## üîÅ Core Design Philosophy

| Principle | Elixir-Driven Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **Shallow Logic** | Flat data, integer counters, tagged maps |
| **Emergent Depth** | Behavior from modular interactions, not hardcoding |
| **Event-Triggered Evaluation** | No polling; systems respond to events/messages |
| **Client-Side Visual Authority** | Server is source-of-truth; client handles rendering |

## üß© System Modules

### üó∫Ô∏è Zone System

**Purpose**: Simulate the world‚Äôs geography and interactive spaces for both **server logic** and **client rendering**, while supporting zone evolution and procedural generation.

#### Server Perspective:
- Zones are built as **2D layered maps** representing **walkable terrain and props**.
- Layers approximate verticality: e.g., multiple buildings' second floors might share a layer, while tall castles may use higher layers due to scale.
- **Hills and slopes are not separate layers** unless one walkable surface passes over another.
- Each zone layer contains:
  - **Collision maps** derived from slope/movement modifiers or explicit collision data
  - **Prop geometry** and structure-defined collision (e.g., walls, doorways)
  - **Transition areas** that connect layers or zones
  - **Movement cost maps** for terrain-aware pathfinding

#### Client Perspective:
- Zones are rendered in **full 3D** with immersive terrain and prop models.
- **Client collision is authoritative for feel**, but **server collision is authoritative for validation**.
- Props and terrain kits have reusable geometry and precise collision definitions (not generic boxes or radii).

#### Props:
- Must define:
  - **Theme tags**
  - **Footprint size**
  - **Family labels** (e.g., furniture, foliage, industrial)
- Props with identical footprints may be hot-swapped for variety or reactivity.
- Props affect the collision layer and entity movement.

#### Procedural World Integration:
- Zones must be generated with:
  - Faction presence
  - Mission hooks
  - Spatial planning for props
  - Historical coherence
- Uses procedural tools + AI (including GPT) to:
  - Create zone geometry
  - Place props
  - Seed story elements

### üß± Schema Engine

**Purpose**: Manage modular character builds using **schemas**, which define loadouts of abilities and augments.

#### Schema Overview:
- A **schema** is an in-game item equipped by the player.
- Each schema includes:
  - **Hexes** ‚Äì slots for **abilities**
  - **Diamonds** ‚Äì slots for **augments**
- A hex can connect to up to **4 adjacent diamonds**; diamonds can be shared.
- Characters can equip up to **3 schemas** (primary, secondary, tertiary):
  - **Primary schema** grants full access
  - **Secondary/tertiary** apply with increasing restrictions

#### Schema Mechanics:
- **Resonance** occurs when ability types match slot expectations (e.g., fire spell in a fire-aligned hex), unlocking extra effects.
- Schemas may provide **set bonuses** for filling specific groups of hexes/diamonds.

#### Interfaces:
```elixir
evaluate_schema(schema) :: [bonus()]
apply_resonance(ability, hex_tag) :: modified_ability()
resolve_augments(cell, context) :: [effect()]
```

#### Acquisition:
- Earned through missions and loot
- Upgraded through crafting paths
- Edited at **Schema Nodes** in safe zones

---

### üéí Equipment System

**Purpose**: Manage character gear, encumbrance, and augment-based bonuses.

#### Mechanics:
- **Slots**: Head, Body, Hands, Feet, etc. (customizable per world)
- **Encumbrance**: Each item has a weight value; capped by player attributes
- **Armor values**, **resistances**, and **special traits** can be granted
- Equipment may contain **augment slots**, scaling with item quality

#### Augment Integration:
- Equipment augments offer passive benefits (e.g., resistances, stat bonuses)
- Changing equipment **triggers a global cooldown**, temporarily disabling ability usage

#### Acquisition:
- Primarily via loot and crafting

---

### üìò Ability System

**Purpose**: Define active and passive powers that modify combat and world interaction.

#### Features:
- **Equipped in schema hexes**
- **Levelable** via XP investment
- **Interacts with augments** to change or enhance effects

#### Examples:
- **Active**: `fireball` ‚Äì projectile with burn
- **Passive**: `fear aura` ‚Äì debuff pulse on proximity

#### Acquisition:
- Missions, drops, rewards

---

### üß© Augment System

**Purpose**: Modular, stackable enhancements used in both schemas and equipment.

#### Dual Functionality:
- In **schemas**, augments alter ability effects dynamically:
  - e.g., `burst shard` converts a single-target attack into AoE
- In **equipment**, augments offer passive traits:
  - e.g., fire resistance, stamina regen

#### Acquisition:
- Loot, crafting, mission rewards

---

### üîÆ Weave Engine

**Purpose**: Dynamically construct abilities from **Essence**, **Form**, and **Modifier** threads placed in schema-adjacent augments.

#### Core Concepts:
- Each ability can be **enhanced by one of each thread type**
- Threads originate from nearby diamond augments
- **Crystallized abilities**: Precompiled, high-power variants
- **Core abilities**: Always available default versions

---

### üîó Glyphcasting System

**Purpose**: Coordinate party tactics and ability chains via symbolic glyphs in real-time.

- Glyphs emitted when certain abilities are used
- Triggers group combo evaluation
- Glyphcasting processes are **per-party**, isolated, and supervised

---

### üåÄ Myth Engine

**Purpose**: Track **myth pressure**, a narrative-weighted value representing world and faction tension across zones.

- Myth pressure increases via player actions, quests, or events
- Can cause:
  - Prop mutation
  - Dungeon spawns
  - Story changes

---

### üó∫Ô∏è ZoneMutator

**Purpose**: Reactively update zones based on myth pressure or live scripting.

- Loads new **terrain templates**
- Swaps tagged props dynamically
- Notifies players and connected systems
- Adjusts collision maps and NPC spawns accordingly

---

### üï≥Ô∏è MSID Manager

**Purpose**: Spawn **Myth-Spawned Instanced Dungeons** based on narrative conditions.

- Triggered by crossing myth thresholds
- Selects from prefab or procedural templates
- Spawns supervised zone processes
- Connected to mission and loot systems

---

## üîß Optimization Tactics

| Technique | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Flat data structures** | Fast lookups, easy pattern matching |
| **Thread hashing** | Cached ability building |
| **Collision layering** | Separation of client visual fidelity and server rules |
| **Hot-swapping props** | Dynamic world evolution without downtime |
| **Behavioral isolation** | Fault tolerance via BEAM supervision trees |

## ‚úÖ Final Summary

**MythWeave** simulates a deeply modular world using Elixir‚Äôs strengths:

- **Resilient process-based systems**
- **Declarative, shallow logic for complex behavior**
- **Runtime evolution of props, stories, and terrain**
- **Player customization through schemas, equipment, and augment synergies**

Its approach combines **efficient server logic** with **rich client experiences**, procedural content, and scalable live simulation‚Äîdesigned for developers, storytellers, and systems thinkers alike.
